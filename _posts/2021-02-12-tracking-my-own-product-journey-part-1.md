  Covid projects, who's got one?! I've had a few, built the kids a fort,
  finished the back yard,  but there's been a few digital projects I've had
  planned for quite a few years that I've never found time to really take
  seriously.

## Writing GPS

1. What is your business goal - care about what you're writing - *I can show that I manage product and think about how to build and iterate on that product. Start small iterate, lean startup way*
2. Reframe - put your reader into it, ask "so what" repeatedly. Express your reframed idea + put this say the top. This is where you are headed - *So what? can people learn from my product journey and apply to their own projects*
3. Seek out data that backs up your main idea. Don't discount your own experience - *Lean startups, what else?*
4. Organise. What structure helps communicate your point? Some options are a list, a how-to guide, and a client narrative. - *A client narrative I think for this one, this will be a series and this is really the short setup.*
5. Write to one person. Imagine the one person you're helping and wrote to them. Use 'you' not they/people/them - *The one person is a product manager tasked with developing a successful product*
6. Produce the first ugly draft. - show up and throw up. Hey the ideas out don't worry about structure/spelling. Just get it down
7. Walk away. Give ideas time to mature. Preferably a day or more
8. Rewrite and reshape the mess. Swap places with your reader.
9. Give it a great headline. Make it irresistible
10. Have someone edit it\*\**
11. One final look for readability. Does it your inviting /easy to scan? Sorry paragraphs and bold subheads, lists bulleted/numbered. Avoid impenetrable chunky text
12. Publish but ask one more question. What next? Read more? Subscribe? But something?

Covid projects, who's got one?! I've had a few, built the kids a fort, finished landscaping the back yard, but there's been a few digital projects I've had planned for longer than I'm willing to admit that I've never found time to really take seriously - or at least that was the excuse I used to justify it.

Like many of my digital peers, my project folder is littered with ideas and passion projects in various states of dust-gathering to be picked up 'one-day' and turned into the next big thing.  Well covid certainly threw us a curve-ball (or six) and challenges for all from job-security, concern over physical health and the impact of our collective mental health, and I am no exception to that. But in a time where time to socialise, explore and travel is limited, then why not make a positive start and build something exciting? Possibly even life changing?!

I've got to give huge kudos to my partner who used her newly found lockdown time to write a novel! and is already working on book number 2 and working out how to publish!  That kind of drive is infectious and since you can't bottle motivation, then its time to start!

I've written about habit forming, so my goal in 2021 is to form key-stone habits in creating. I'm going to start small and work on a passion project I've had in my toolbox for nearly 5 years, right now its unnamed, but I will be writing and tracking its progress (and likely its pitfalls here). Writing is powerful in creating habits and holding yourself accountable, this is where I choose to tell the world about my process of creating and developing something for me.

Who knows? it could turn into a business, an opportunity or relegated to page 68 on the app store, but for now starting is enough.

## The project

I love to cook. It relaxes me, brings out my creative flair, the smells and flavours excite me.  How can I improve this recipe or make something completely new?  Maybe this will be a taste sensation!

But.. The online recipe experience frustrates me endlessly,

## But I'm too busy!

Suck it! I'm not going to go into life challenges.  I have those, and so does everyone else who does not have the luxury of not having to work. This is about choices and its all too easy to make the easy choice, to sit on the sofa eating dinner watching Netflix. I will do that from time to time, I like doing that, but I will make time to do this.

5am starts, sounds horrendous, and I have failed before, so I need to start making this happen.
