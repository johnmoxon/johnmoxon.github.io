## T﻿he robots are coming...

I﻿n 2023 AI or at least machine learning not only took a huge leap forward in technological advancement, but a monumental leap in public awareness.

C﻿hatGPT is now regularly raised as a topic of conversation as easily at the pub, and in board meetings as it is at a IT meetup.

It's not really fair to say the technology is in its infancy either.  Adaptive ML models have been in use and gathering seped since xxx.  What's changed is that the clever people at OpenAI, have literally put things in *words we can understand*.



## So will the machines take my job?

Well foregoing a Terminator 2 style apocalypse for a second, thats generally not how we've seen new industrial and technological revolutions occur, and yes I do believe we are now on the edge of another one of those revolutions.

R shouldn't be feared, the internet. revolutionised , the most recent working revolution most of us will remember turned out alright? But it did bring in sweeping changes to nearly every aspect of the way we live and work. 

Can you imagine the impact to your time, the books you would need to trawl, the phone calls you would need to make to answer a simple question which would now be answered by _let me google that for you?_

## Writing GPS

1. What is your business goal - care about what you're writing
2. Reframe - put your reader into it, ask "so what" repeatedly. Express your reframed idea + put this at the top. This is where you are headed
3. Seek out data that backs up your main idea. Don't discount your own experience
4. Organise. What structure helps communicate your point? Some options are a list, a how-to guide, and a client narrative.
5. Write to one person. Imagine the one person you're helping and wrote to them. Use 'you' not they/people/them
6. Produce the first ugly draft. *Show up and throw up*. Get the ideas out don't worry about structure/spelling. Just get it down
7. Walk away. Give ideas time to mature. Preferably a day or more
8. Rewrite and reshape the mess. Swap places with your reader.
9. Give it a great headline. Make it irresistible
10. Have someone edit it\*\**
11. One final look for readability. Does it look inviting/easy to scan? Short paragraphs and bold subheads, lists bulleted/numbered. Avoid impenetrable chunky text blocks
12. Publish but ask one more question. What next? Read more? Subscribe? But something?
