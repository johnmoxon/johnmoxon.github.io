  Covid projects, who's got one?! I've had a few, built the kids a fort,
  finished the back yard,  but there's been a few digital projects I've had
  planned for quite a few years that I've never found time to really take
  seriously.

## Writing GPS

1. What is your business goal - care about what you're writing - *I can show that I manage product and think about how to build and iterate on that product. Start small iterate, lean startup way.*

   > *To put it another way this post is about, motivation, starting something, building experience in product-management*
2. Reframe - put your reader into it, ask "so what" repeatedly. Express your reframed idea + put this say the top. This is where you are headed - *So what? can people learn from my product journey and apply to their own projects*

   > *My reader is involved in product management or product development, or they have a product or project they have in some state of initial progress. So what?*
   >
   > *They know they could achieve something, they are excited about the prospect, but something is stopping them - so what*
   >
   > *This article will propose simple steps and small changes to make sure that it gets done.*
3. Seek out data that backs up your main idea. Don't discount your own experience - *Lean startups, what else?*

   > *Leader with no title*\
   > Lean Startup\
   > Power of Habit
4. Organise. What structure helps communicate your point? Some options are a list, a how-to guide, and a client narrative. - *A client narrative I think for this one, this will be a series and this is really the short setup.*
5. Write to one person. Imagine the one person you're helping and wrote to them. Use 'you' not they/people/them - *The one person is a product manager tasked with developing a successful product*
6. Produce the first ugly draft. - show up and throw up. Hey the ideas out don't worry about structure/spelling. Just get it down
7. Walk away. Give ideas time to mature. Preferably a day or more
8. Rewrite and reshape the mess. Swap places with your reader.
9. Give it a great headline. Make it irresistible
10. Have someone edit it\*\**
11. One final look for readability. Does it your inviting /easy to scan? Sorry paragraphs and bold subheads, lists bulleted/numbered. Avoid impenetrable chunky text
12. Publish but ask one more question. What next? Read more? Subscribe? But something?

Covid projects, who's got one?! I've had a few, built a fort for the kids, finished landscaping the backyard, and finished a handful of books. But what about that passion project? the one you've had planned for longer than your willing to admit? that you've never found the time to take seriously? - or at least that's the excuse!

Speaking to my colleagues in digital fields, I'm not alone. Many of us have project folders littered with half-started ideas gathering dust, because one-day...

### Thanks Covid! Let's Do this!

\[meme here - I can accomplish anything!]

Well 2020 certainly threw us a curve-ball didn't it! challenges to job-security, concern over physical and mental wellbeing. But in a time where time to socialise, explore and travel is limited, then why not make a positive start and build something exciting? Possibly even life changing?!

I've got to give huge kudos to my partner who used her newly found lockdown time to write a novel! and is already working on book number 2 and working out how to publish! Surrounding yourself with driven people is a great way to boost your own motivation, that kind of drive is infectious even competitive. Motivation can also be fleeting, sporadic and challenging to fit around a busy lifestyle. You can't bottle motivation, so strike while the iron is hot and start today!

I love that quote from Simon Sinek, starting is often the hardest part as I wrote about in my last post [why it's hard to start new things]({% post_url 2020-07-06-the-difficult-first-post %})

I've written about habit forming, so my goal in 2021 is to form key-stone habits in creating. I'm going to start small and work on a passion project I've had in my toolbox for nearly 5 years, right now its unnamed, but I will be writing and tracking its progress (and likely its pitfalls here). Writing is powerful in creating habits and holding yourself accountable, this is where I choose to tell the world about my process of creating and developing something for me.

Who knows? it could turn into a business, an opportunity or relegated to page 68 on the app store, but for now starting is enough.

## The project

I love to cook. It relaxes me, brings out my creative flair, the smells and flavours excite me.  How can I improve this recipe or make something completely new?  Maybe this will be a taste sensation!

But.. The online recipe experience frustrates me endlessly,

## But I'm too busy!

Suck it! I'm not going to go into life challenges.  I have those, we all do. Finding time to improve my self, to learn and do something different is about choices. It's very easy to make the easy choice, to sit on the sofa eating dinner watching Netflix. I will do that from time to time, I like doing that, but I will make time to do this.

5am starts, sounds horrendous, and I have failed before, so I need to start making this happen.
