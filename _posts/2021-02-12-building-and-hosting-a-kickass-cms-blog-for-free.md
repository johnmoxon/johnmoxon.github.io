## Writing GPS
1. What is your business goal - care about what you're writing
2. Reframe - put your reader into it, ask "so what" repeatedly. Express your reframed idea + put this say the top. This is where you are headed
3. Seek out data that backs up your main idea. Don't discount your own experience
4. Organise. What structure helps communicate your point? Some options are a list, a how-to guide, and a client narrative.
5. Write to one person. Imagine the one person you're helping and wrote to them. Use 'you' not they/people/them
6. Produce the first ugly draft. - show up and throw up. Hey the ideas out don't worry about structure/spelling. Just get it down
7. Walk away. Give ideas time to mature. Preferably a day or more
8. Rewrite and reshape the mess. Swap places with your reader.
9. Give it a great headline. Make it irresistible
10. Have someone edit it***
11. One final look for readability. Does it your inviting /easy to scan? Sorry paragraphs and bold subheads, lists bulleted/numbered. Avoid impenetrable chunky text
12. Publish but ask one more question. What next? Read more? Subscribe? But something?
