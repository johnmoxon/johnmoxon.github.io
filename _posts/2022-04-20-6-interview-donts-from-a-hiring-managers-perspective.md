summary: "Interviews are peculiar situations. They're a short window into "
---
Throughout my leadership career and even before I became a leader I have sat in, or conducted 100's of interviews, and although every one of them is different, the ones you remember, the standout candidates generally fall into a just one of two categories. You either blew me away and I was in awe of your technical competency, your people skills, your ability to take complex subject matter and spin it into an engaging concise snippet, or you left an impression at the other end of the scale that compelled me to write a lengthy blog post on what not to do in an interview.

This is that post. It's kind of cathartic! and a little ranty.. _felt brave, may delete later!_

It is however from the heart and designed to help you (and me) navigate what can be a stressful and anxiety inducing situation. I'll happily admit I have made many of the mistakes I am about to describe. Sometimes you only see it when sitting on the other side of the table, and I often cringe when I think back to past interviews and how I may have come across.

If you haven't interviewed in a while it is easy to fall into some of these traps.  You have built up competency, experience and a good reputation, why wouldn't they want you? Though as it turns out, reputation unless it transcends the organisation you are currently in, does not earn points when interviewing at a different company.

As a side note, this a great reason to build your profile and a reputation online and within your industry network. Though this is an article in of itself I'll explore at a later date.

## Don't assume your resume told us what we need to know
Got to say this is my number 1 pet hate and frustration in interviews. Yes we have read your resume, a good employer has likely gone even further and done their own research into your background and key achievements.  If you have made it to the interview stage it's a pretty safe bet to assume the interviewer thinks you can technically do the job, but that alone is not enough. 

An attitude of _why are you asking me that, it's on my resume_ entirely misses the point of why and what you are being asked. 

This question is really asking you to demonstrate your communication skills and show the depth of your experience. Anyone can say they are an expert in a field on paper. An interviewer wants to hear you speak about it, they want you to hear you add colour and depth to what is likely to have been just a few lines of text on your resume.

Yes we want to satisfy ourselves you are the real deal, but really what an interviewer is looking for is and indication of how you communicate, the challenges that presented and how you overcame them. We want to hear what you are passionate about. We want to hear that you were invested in the outcome and worked to make it a success rather than just being there to collect a paycheck.

> You've read my resume so I won't go into that...

In the worst instances it can come across as arrogance. It may not be the intent, but it's never a good look. If I'm interviewing, I'll always choose quiet confidence over resolute belief.

## Don't bad mouth your previous employer

I can't believe this one needs to be said, but I've seen it so many times its proven it really does. It's almost a instant **no** vote when this one comes up. I'll generally push through and keep the interview going to see if it can be redeemed, but it leaves an impression that is hard to come back from.

No doubt there are some terrible employers out there, and finding a company whose culture is not only positive, but in line with your own values is extremely important for longevity and a positive employee experience.

The trick is in how you spin it.  Any employer wants to know that you are not going to speak about them the same way you are bad mouthing your current or previous employer, hopefully that goes without question. Though it also goes a little deeper. No one loves their job every day (if you do, never leave), but there are those who look for the positives in bad situations. They either choose to look for ways to improve their situation or they look to move on, either is fine. Those that choose to live in the negative, choose to give up control and become a victim. In Australia and the majority of the western world, we are protected from becoming a victim in our workplace. It's not always an easy or safe choice to choose not to be a victim, but it is always the right decision.  Robin Sharma in his book The leader with no title invites you to list all the ways you are choosing to become a victim and take control ([check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5-iGA_zEKY)).

An employer (and interviewer) is looking for candidates with resilience. Those who work through negative situations to improve things rather than accepting the status quo.  

 


**Tip:** jump on [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com) and read up on the prospective company before you apply. Do take any review site with a healthy pinch of salt, but it can be an effective way to avoid some of the main offenders.

## Avoid negativity -> find the positives in bad experiences

## Don't tell me you've never made a mistake.
This question is not designed to trip you out, though granted it can feel that way. 

The truth is we've all made mistakes, if you haven't, then time to gain some self awareness and try again.  The important thing is that we don't make mistakes that are too big (we take a risk based approach) and that we learn from them. 

## Don't walk into an interview thinking your not experienced enough
The fact you are in an interview at all 

## Don't answer, no when asked if you have any questions
Show you are interest by asking questions

Potentially I should add a box of "what you are really being asked.." - a callout box

## Writing GPS
1. What is your business goal - care about what you're writing
2. Reframe - put your reader into it, ask "so what" repeatedly. Express your reframed idea + put this at the top. This is where you are headed
3. Seek out data that backs up your main idea. Don't discount your own experience
4. Organise. What structure helps communicate your point? Some options are a list, a how-to guide, and a client narrative.
5. Write to one person. Imagine the one person you're helping and wrote to them. Use 'you' not they/people/them
6. Produce the first ugly draft. _Show up and throw up_. Get the ideas out don't worry about structure/spelling. Just get it down
7. Walk away. Give ideas time to mature. Preferably a day or more
8. Rewrite and reshape the mess. Swap places with your reader.
9. Give it a great headline. Make it irresistible
10. Have someone edit it***
11. One final look for readability. Does it look inviting/easy to scan? Short paragraphs and bold subheads, lists bulleted/numbered. Avoid impenetrable chunky text blocks
12. Publish but ask one more question. What next? Read more? Subscribe? But something?
