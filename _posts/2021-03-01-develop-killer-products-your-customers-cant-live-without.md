There is power in the data you already collect and touchpoints you have with your customers. Learn from big tech and how they use that data to not only drive sales and increase customer base, but identify and develop new products their customers need but never knew they wanted.

so what?

Huge opportunities exist in the data you collect from your customers, their purchases and interactions with you that could be the key to unlocking new markets, new products and new revenue streams. Accessing the data you collect may take effort and investment, but the opportunities could be worth that investment multiple times over.

## Writing GPS
1. What is your business goal - care about what you're writing
2. Reframe - put your reader into it, ask "so what" repeatedly. Express your reframed idea + put this say the top. This is where you are headed
3. Seek out data that backs up your main idea. Don't discount your own experience
4. Organise. What structure helps communicate your point? Some options are a list, a how-to guide, and a client narrative.
5. Write to one person. Imagine the one person you're helping and wrote to them. Use 'you' not they/people/them
6. Produce the first ugly draft. - show up and throw up. Hey the ideas out don't worry about structure/spelling. Just get it down
7. Walk away. Give ideas time to mature. Preferably a day or more
8. Rewrite and reshape the mess. Swap places with your reader.
9. Give it a great headline. Make it irresistible
10. Have someone edit it***
11. One final look for readability. Does it your inviting /easy to scan? Sorry paragraphs and bold subheads, lists bulleted/numbered. Avoid impenetrable chunky text
12. Publish but ask one more question. What next? Read more? Subscribe? But something?




### Is Google / Alexa listening to me? Yes.
1. History, 
2. How the big players do it
3. How you can start
- You probably already know a lot about your customers
- Probably report on this stuff.  How can you do it quicker and move from reports to insights
4. Is it ethical?
5. the future
