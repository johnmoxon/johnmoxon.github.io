I'll be honest, I put off writing this for a long time, I think I first started writing this article back in May 2020 but it was still bit raw back then and took some time to process.  Things changed, life happened and this article got stuffed to the bottom of the drafts folder. But something wouldn't let it go and it felt important to get this out there.
