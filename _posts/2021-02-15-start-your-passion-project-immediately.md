  Covid projects, who's got one?! I've had a few, built the kids a fort,
  finished the back yard,  but there's been a few digital projects I've had
  planned for quite a few years that I've never found time to really take
  seriously.

The difficult first post! I've been planning to write from my experience for longer than I want to admit. I hope over time, that writing down what I've learned will become second nature, an extension of my career and leadership journey. Though today, writing is hard.

It's not for a lack of ideas, I've mapped out many topics I intend to cover and give back to the industry that has given me so much. But today writing is difficult, unnatural, the sentences do not flow freely. It therefore seems fitting to talk about the challenge of starting new things.

There are endless articles that do a much better job of covering [why it's hard to start something genuinely new](https://findlink.com). **Next sentence no longer makes sense - edit** Insightful and vulnerable pieces that highlight why fear is such a factor for us. But what if the thing that is hard to start is something you are already good at? Perhaps even paid for?

Today I'm talking about passion projects, take all that skill, training and experience that you lend to your employer every day, and do the same but for you.

The mobile app idea you had 2 years ago which could have had a hundred thousand downloads by now, the book you meant to write you know would be an instant classic, the side-hustle your friends have been telling you all year you would rock!

You're not alone. Chat to any creative colleague you will find similar stories of half finished or never started projects that could have been the next big thing. So what separates the people who could, from the people who do? For those of us driven enough to give it a shot, how can we shift our mindsets to doing?

There are [huge benefits in starting your own passion project](https://kraylfunch.com/5-benefits-of-creating-a-passion-project/). Explore directions you have not been able to go in your professional work, develop new skills and experience you would have otherwise not been exposed to. Even if it doesn't turn into a business, then you will have created positive habits that will last you a lifetime and will have reached new contacts and opportunities.

## So why haven't you started yet?

Full disclosure. I am a creative person who has developed and launched incredibly successful products for other people and also have a folder bursting at the seams of half-started and unloved projects that could just be the next big thing...

Even if you are confident in your skills and the quality of your idea, starting something on your own and following your own path without a team having your back is scary! What if it's not good enough? What if people hate it? Or worse, ignore it? 

Overcoming the innate fear associated with starting something new is a significant obstacle and does require a leap of faith.

Finding the time not only start but continue to put the effort to see passion projects through can also be a challenge. The struggle is real! We are more time poor than ever before. Adulting, working a 9to5, taking care of kids is enough of a juggle, add unlimited content, socialising, entertainment and devices vying for our attention and it is easy to fall into a pattern of "I'm just too busy".

## Okay, Thanks Covid! Let's Do this!

Don't get me wrong, there have not been many positives to come out of our current situation, but if you have found yourself at home a lot more than usual, then you have been given an opportunity to start building positive habits that will far outlive our current situation. 

Habits are powerful things, and they tend to be associated with negative behaviours. Though forming positive key-stone habits is just as powerful in 

{This paragraph will talk about habit forming}

For my own journey, writing this piece is the start, creating accountability in myself by sharing this online is my first step. I'll continue to write more about my own product journey, the good, bad and ugly. 

So next time you are feeling motivated and ponder _What if_, ask _"What if it's spectacular?"_, _"What if it's the start of something exciting? Possibly even life changing?!"_. And then start **immediately!** You can't bottle motivation, it is fleeting, so start now.

## Writing GPS

1. What is your business goal - care about what you’re writing - *I can show that I manage product and think about how to build and iterate on that product. Start small iterate, lean startup way.* *To put it another way this post is about, motivation, starting something, building experience in product-management*
2. Reframe - put your reader into it, ask “so what” repeatedly. Express your reframed idea + put this say the top. This is where you are headed - *So what? can people learn from my product journey and apply to their own projects* *My reader is involved in product management or product development, or they have a product or project they have in some state of initial progress. So what?* *They know they could achieve something, they are excited about the prospect, but something is stopping them - so what* *This article will propose simple steps and small changes to make sure that it gets done.*
3. Seek out data that backs up your main idea. Don’t discount your own experience -

   * Lean startups, what else?
   * Leader with no title
   * Lean Startup
   * Power of Habit
4. Organise. What structure helps communicate your point? Some options are a list, a how-to guide, and a client narrative. -

* A client narrative I think for this one, this will be a series and this is really the short setup.

1. Write to one person. Imagine the one person you’re helping and wrote to them. Use ‘you’ not they/people/them -

   * The one person is a product manager tasked with developing a successful product
2. Produce the first ugly draft. - show up and throw up. Hey the ideas out don’t worry about structure/spelling. Just get it down
3. Walk away. Give ideas time to mature. Preferably a day or more
4. Rewrite and reshape the mess. Swap places with your reader.
5. Give it a great headline. Make it irresistible
6. Have someone edit it\*\**
7. One final look for readability. Does it your inviting /easy to scan? Sorry paragraphs and bold subheads, lists bulleted/numbered. Avoid impenetrable chunky text
8. ## Publish but ask one more question. What next? Read more? Subscribe? But something?
