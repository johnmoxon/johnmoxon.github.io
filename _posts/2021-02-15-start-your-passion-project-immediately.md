  Covid projects, who's got one?! I've had a few, built the kids a fort,
  finished the back yard,  but there's been a few digital projects I've had
  planned for quite a few years that I've never found time to really take
  seriously.

The difficult first post! I've been planning to write from my experience for longer than I'd like to admit. I hope over time, that writing down what I've learned will become second nature, an extension of my leadership and career journey. Though today, writing is hard.

It's not for a lack of ideas, I've mapped out many topics I intend to cover and give back to the industry that has given me a career. But today writing is difficult, unnatural, sentences do not flow freely. It therefore seems fitting to talk about starting new things.

There are endless articles written like \[article 1] and \[article 2] that do a much better job of covering why it's hard to start something genuinely new, like driving, public speaking etc. and fear is the common factor. _Can I actually do this thing?  be successful?_, _will people hate? But what if its something you already know you're good at? Perhaps even paid for?

I'm talking about passion projects, take all that skill, training and experience that you lend to your employer day in day out, and do the same but for you.

The mobile app idea you had 2 years ago which could have had a hundred thousand downloads by now, the book you you know would be a hit, the side-hustle your friends have been telling you all year you would rock!

You're not alone. Chat to any colleague in a creative industry you will find stories of half finished or never started projects that could have been the next big thing. So what separates the people who could from the people who do? For those driven enough to give it a shot, how can we shift our mindsets to doing?

Full disclosure. I am a creative person who has developed and launched incredibly successful products for other people and also have a folder bursting at the seams of half-started and unloved projects that could just be the next big thing...

### So why haven't you started yet?

Even if you are confident in your skills and the quality of your ideas, doing something on your own and following your own path without a team having your back is scary! What if it's not good enough? what if it's people hate it, or worse, ignore it? 

Overcoming that innate fear is a significant obstacle and requires a leap of faith.

Finding the time not only start but continue to put the effort to see passion projects through can also be a challenge. The struggle is real! We are more time poor than ever before. Adulting, working a 9to5, taking care of kids is enough of a juggle, add unlimited content, socialising, entertainment and devices vying for our attention and it is easy to fall into a pattern of "I'm just too busy".

### Okay, Thanks Covid! Let's Do this!

Don't get me wrong, there have not been many positives to come out of our current situation, but if you find yourself at home and bored, look it as an opportunity to build positive habits that will far outlive the pandemic. 

{This paragraph will talk about habit forming}

For my own journey, writing this piece is the start, creating accountability in myself by sharing this online is my first step. I'll continue to write more about my own product journey, the good, bad and ugly. 

So next time you are feeling motivated and ponder _What if_, ask _"What if it's spectacular?"_, _"What if it's the start of something exciting? Possibly even life changing?!"_. And then start **immediately!** You can't bottle motivation, it is fleeting, so start now.

## Writing GPS

1. What is your business goal - care about what you’re writing - *I can show that I manage product and think about how to build and iterate on that product. Start small iterate, lean startup way.* *To put it another way this post is about, motivation, starting something, building experience in product-management*
2. Reframe - put your reader into it, ask “so what” repeatedly. Express your reframed idea + put this say the top. This is where you are headed - *So what? can people learn from my product journey and apply to their own projects* *My reader is involved in product management or product development, or they have a product or project they have in some state of initial progress. So what?* *They know they could achieve something, they are excited about the prospect, but something is stopping them - so what* *This article will propose simple steps and small changes to make sure that it gets done.*
3. Seek out data that backs up your main idea. Don’t discount your own experience -

   * Lean startups, what else?
   * Leader with no title
   * Lean Startup
   * Power of Habit
4. Organise. What structure helps communicate your point? Some options are a list, a how-to guide, and a client narrative. -

* A client narrative I think for this one, this will be a series and this is really the short setup.

1. Write to one person. Imagine the one person you’re helping and wrote to them. Use ‘you’ not they/people/them -

   * The one person is a product manager tasked with developing a successful product
2. Produce the first ugly draft. - show up and throw up. Hey the ideas out don’t worry about structure/spelling. Just get it down
3. Walk away. Give ideas time to mature. Preferably a day or more
4. Rewrite and reshape the mess. Swap places with your reader.
5. Give it a great headline. Make it irresistible
6. Have someone edit it\*\**
7. One final look for readability. Does it your inviting /easy to scan? Sorry paragraphs and bold subheads, lists bulleted/numbered. Avoid impenetrable chunky text
8. ## Publish but ask one more question. What next? Read more? Subscribe? But something?
