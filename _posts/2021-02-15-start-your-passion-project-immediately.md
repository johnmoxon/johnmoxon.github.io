  Covid projects, who's got one?! I've had a few, built the kids a fort,
  finished the back yard,  but there's been a few digital projects I've had
  planned for quite a few years that I've never found time to really take
  seriously.

The difficult first post! I've been planning to write from my experience for longer than I want to admit. I hope over time, that writing down what I've learned will become second nature, an extension of my career and leadership journey. Though today, writing is hard.

It's not for a lack of ideas, I've mapped out many topics I intend to cover and give back to the industry that has given me so much. But today writing is difficult, unnatural, the sentences do not flow freely. It therefore seems fitting to talk about the challenge of starting new things.

There are endless articles that do a much better job of covering [why it's hard to start something genuinely new](https://medium.com/swlh/why-starting-is-the-hardest-part-and-how-to-overcome-it-ab87f5d1b577), and how to overcome the fear that prevents us from experiencing new things. But what if the thing you are struggling to start is something you are already good at? Perhaps even paid for?

## Why start your passion project?

Take all that skill you have honed, the training and experience you have built up over several years, that you lend to your employer every day, and do the same but for you.

The mobile app idea you had 2 years ago which could have had a hundred thousand downloads by now, the book you meant to write you know would be an instant classic, the side-hustle your friends have been telling you all year you would rock!

> After that things can only get better<br>
> <cite>&mdash; Stephen King</cite>

You're not alone. Chat to any creative colleague you will find similar stories of half finished or never started projects that could have been the next big thing. So what separates the people who could, from the people who do? For those of us driven enough to give it a shot, how can we shift our mindsets to doing?

There are [huge benefits in starting your own passion project](https://kraylfunch.com/5-benefits-of-creating-a-passion-project/). Explore directions you have not been able to go in your professional life, develop new skills and experience you would have otherwise not been exposed to. Even if it doesn't turn into a business, then you will hopefully have created positive habits that will last you a lifetime and will have reached new contacts and opportunities.

## So why haven't you started yet?

Full disclosure. I am a creative person who has developed and launched incredibly successful products for other people and also have a folder bursting at the seams of half-started and unloved projects that could just be the next big thing...

Even if you are confident in your skills and the quality of your idea, starting something on your own and following your own path without a team having your back is scary! What if it's not good enough? What if people hate it? Or worse, ignore it? 

Overcoming the innate fear associated with starting something new is a significant obstacle and does require a leap of faith.

Finding the time not only to start but continue putting in the effort to see passion projects through can also be a challenge. We are more time poor than ever before. Adulting, working a 9to5, taking care of kids is enough of a juggle, add unlimited content, socialising, entertainment and devices all vying for our attention and it is easy to fall into a pattern of "I'm just too busy".

## Okay, Thanks Covid! Let's Do this!

Don't get me wrong, there have not been many positives to come out of our current situation, but if you have found yourself at home a lot more than usual, then you have been given an opportunity to make a start on that passion project you have been putting off for so long. If you've ever tried (and failed) to get your passion project off the ground you will know that going about things the same way will typically result in the same outcome. You start with the best intentions, you are motivate and produce a flash of inspiration. Things are looking good! then inevitably life interjects. You get busy at work, your car needs fixing and your friends just invited you to come out tonight. The project gets tucked away and you have quickly fallen into habits that means it will stay there again until the motivation (or guilt) strikes you to try again.

Habits are more powerful than most of us have ever stopped to think about until you want to get rid or change one. Some habits we fall into like snacking, watching Netflix at the end of a long day. 

Some habiare designed and purposeful like going for a morning run or visiting the gym at lunchtime. All though habits follow the same pattern, _[cue, crave, response and reward](https://jamesclear.com/habit-triggers)_. There's been much research put into understanding the role that habits play in our lives and several books that are worth checking out [Atomic habits by James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) and [XXX The Power of Habit]


Being too busy and having time to succeed requires you to make touch choices, prioritise and sacrifice 

then you will need to make working on it a  habit, just like brushing your teeth or remembering your keys as you leave the house.




 some are in some many areas of our lives and are generally associated with negative behaviours, though forming positive habits can be even more powerful and help to ensure success in many areas of our professional and personal lives. Athletes, doctors, founders and CEO's through many industries have used positive _keystone_ habits to achieve success. Wherh

You brush your teeth without thinking about it, it is instinctual in fact a need, and you couldn't possibly think of leaving the house without doing it.  

to  understood and harnessed habits and the  to create positive behaviours that emanate 

There are many great books about how habits shape our lives, how companies, athletes and global movements have used habits to make change. [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/habit-guide) 

{examples of modern keystone habits - get up early, }

{cover choices - habit of netflix rather than learn}

{cover planning, free jira etc}

> It doesn't matter where we start.<br>

For my own journey, writing this piece is the start, creating accountability in myself by sharing this online is my first step. I'll continue to write more about my own product journey, the good, bad and ugly. 

So next time you are feeling motivated, resist the urge to turn on Netflix and ponder _What if_, _"What if it's spectacular?"_, _"What if it's the start of something exciting? Possibly even life changing?!"_. And then start **immediately!** You can't bottle motivation, it is fleeting, so start now.

## Writing GPS

1. What is your business goal - care about what you’re writing - Motivating myself and other people to start something new.

2. Reframe - put your reader into it, ask “so what” repeatedly. Express your reframed idea + put this say the top. This is where you are headed - *So what? can people learn from my product journey and apply to their own projects* *My reader is involved in product management or product development, or they have a product or project they have in some state of initial progress. So what?* *They know they could achieve something, they are excited about the prospect, but something is stopping them - so what* *This article will propose simple steps and small changes to make sure that it gets done.*

3. Seek out data that backs up your main idea. Don’t discount your own experience -

   * Lean startups, what else?
   * Leader with no title
   * Lean Startup
   * Power of Habit
4. Organise. What structure helps communicate your point? Some options are a list, a how-to guide, and a client narrative. -

* A client narrative I think for this one, this will be a series and this is really the short setup.

1. Write to one person. Imagine the one person you’re helping and wrote to them. Use ‘you’ not they/people/them -

   * The one person is a product manager tasked with developing a successful product
2. Produce the first ugly draft. - show up and throw up. Hey the ideas out don’t worry about structure/spelling. Just get it down
3. Walk away. Give ideas time to mature. Preferably a day or more
4. Rewrite and reshape the mess. Swap places with your reader.
5. Give it a great headline. Make it irresistible
6. Have someone edit it\*\**
7. One final look for readability. Does it your inviting /easy to scan? Sorry paragraphs and bold subheads, lists bulleted/numbered. Avoid impenetrable chunky text
8. ## Publish but ask one more question. What next? Read more? Subscribe? But something?
