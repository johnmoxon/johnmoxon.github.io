<h1 class="text-center">Hi I'm John</h1>

My name is John and I'm a full-stack web developer, technical team lead and project manager based in Brisbane, Australia.  I've been in the industry since 2002 and have built sites and apps for telecommunications / publishing organisations, web development agencies and leisure/travel providers.

I love to solve problems, I love standards in both web practice and standardised business systems, and I love to automate work-flows.  My passion comes from seeing problems and in-efficiencies in everyday working practices and working to improve productivity and remove development barriers, automating the mundane wherever possible.

I have had great success implementing vitualised provisioned local-develop-server environments in large development teams using [Vagrant][vagrant] and [puppet][puppet]. Enabling new team members to get up and running quickly on standardised, _always up-to-date_, production-like environment, matching live hosting capabilities, resulting in drastically fewer _surprises_ when deploying work.

There are so many great tools out there that can improve a development team's productivity, reduce errors and automate the boring stuff so we can concentrate on the fun stuff! I'm on a mission to find the right tools for the right job to overcome the challenges that many businesses face when implementing an effective production work-flow.

My current favourite is Gulp.jsgulp-js which I'll be covering in a future article. Gulp.js is a [node-js][node-js] based [streaming build system](https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook) and task runner that is kicking up a storm in web development circles right now.  Gulp excels in running tasks with maximum concurrency meaning lightning quick builds, written in readable familiar javascript code.  Gulp.js build files are code not configuration like [Grunt][grunt-js], so readability of your build process is greatly improved.
