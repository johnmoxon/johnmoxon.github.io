<h1 class="text-center">Hi I'm John</h1>

My name is John and I'm a full-stack web developer, technical team lead and project manager based in Brisbane, Australia.  I've been in the industry since 2002 and have built sites and apps for telecommunications / publishing organisations, web development agencies and leisure/travel providers.
