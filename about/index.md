<h1 class="text-center">Hi I'm John</h1>

My name is John and I'm a full-stack web developer, technical team lead and project manager based in Brisbane, Australia.  I've been in the industry since 2003 and have built sites and apps for publishing companies, web development agencies and leisure/travel industries.

I love to solve problems, I love standards in both web practice and standardised business systems, and I love to automate workflows
